ðŸ”­  Goggles is a GUI for your $GOPATH.

## Install

### Stable

Grab the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/KyleBanks/goggles/releases) page. 

**Note:** It is currently a known issue that Goggles can only be run via the command-line with `open Goggles.app`, simply double-clicking `Goggles.app` has issues finding your $GOPATH.

### From Source

In order to build and run Goggles, there are a few steps you'll need to take:

1. `go get github.com/KyleBanks/goggles/...`
2. Install [Gallium](https://github.com/alexflint/gallium), in order to bundle the `.app`.
3. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), in order to build the front-end assets.
4. Run `make` to build and launch the application.

**Note:** Goggles is currently only available for Mac OS. If you'd like to see Goggles available on additional platforms, I encourage you to help contribute to the [Gallium](https://github.com/alexflint/gallium) project.
